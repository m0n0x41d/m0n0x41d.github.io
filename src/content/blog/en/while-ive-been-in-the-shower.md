While I was in the shower, an "AI dev agency" analyzed my game idea, threw together a prototype, and deployed a preview.

Oh brave new strange world - are developers no longer needed?

Yes, no jokes, the world is truly frightening, or rather the speed at which it's changing.

If 4-5 months ago "vibe coding" was a joke I actively participated in, today new models with larger context and reasoning capabilities are seriously junior++ level.

Problems with actual thinking (its absence) and design that still plague generated code aren't such big problems. In terms of trade-offs – the code works, and the prototype delivery speed is 7 minutes.

It would take me at least 4 days.

The new world is absolutely clear in the speed and vector of its development.

But I'm not scared, at all.

A world where artificial intelligence takes over much of the work or even supremacy over humans is not the world of the space ark from the WALL-E cartoon where imbecile and obese people forgot how to walk.

Although... I don't exclude such a vector of "evolution."

I think the language of communication between AI and humans won't be baby talk. More precisely – AI will communicate with us according to our level of intellectual development – with idiots in an idiotic way, with engineers in an engineering way.

> ChatGPT please describe me like I am 5yo VS ChatGPT reason like PhD in <TOPIC> while you answer my questions about it.
 
Feel the difference? The difference is only in our intention – to endlessly become dumber or smarter.

And that's why there's no fear.

First – you can hardly influence anything outside.
Second – everything you need to influence is inside.

If tomorrow programmers aren't needed at all (which is still unlikely, it's just that software engineering is now new - AI augmented. And there will be even more AI in the future, and even greater demands for engineering rather than monkeycode competencies), I'll go to a robotized machine-building factory or somewhere else to solve ontological/methodological problems there.

If a world comes where such engineering work is no longer required – it's either utopia or dystopia, or most likely – the extinction of humanity.
