Oh dear, here we go again.

I have attempted to start a blog multiple times, each with the goal of building what is known as a "personal brand" and sharing insights from my IT career.

However, each attempt resulted in the same mistakes.

I found myself only writing about complex topics I had learned; each post was dense and complicated.

It's okay to write lengthy posts occasionally, but doing so every time? And always about complex topics? Did anyone even ask for this?

No.

## The Mistakes

The first mistake is related to the content. 

I still believe that all my previous posts are excellent! Really, they might be *too academic and boring*, but they are still valuable.

**At least to me, and to the 1-2 people reading my blog**...

Clearly, the purpose of "sharing" has been lost, I would like to share with more than 2 people.

No one asked me to write computer science and software design "whitepapers", but I enjoyed it. 

That was until my workload increased significantly, making writing a strenuous challenge, with some weeks involving only 4-5 hours of sleep per night.

I know youngsters can handle that; I was the same. But now, such a lifestyle is a way to zombieland.

I just can't continue like this. 

Each of the last posts was a digest of dozens of computer science materials, essentially summaries or extracts from various sources I studied and tried to clarify. 
And this material, well... Tough. 

Hold on, are you thinking I am giving up on my blog? Nope.

Why then did I change the domain? :trollface:

## It's Fine

Making mistakes is part of being human. We can either regress to our primal instincts or evolve towards becoming cyborgs. But we are still here.

I think that intelligence isn't just about adapting to changes; it's also about reflecting on mistakes and making an effort to avoid repeating them.

And here I am, once again. 

Why do I even need this "personal brand"? Meh.

## Nerds

Most people in our industry are nerds and introverts; I'm no exception.

Just ask my CTO at Monite how difficult it is to get me to introduce our team at demo meetings :)

> I am still winning.

Yet, having a personal brand is beneficial for building your career. I believe it's one of the best ways to establish yourself as an expert—a knowledgeable and sentient being.

For whom? I'm not sure. For the world? For head-hunters? For colleagues? It seems so.

And here, the importance of sharing remains paramount to me.

## The Fixes

Firstly, my name is already indexed well by search engines, but the top links are to LinkedIn and Dev.to.

And what on earth is *wannahack.in*?

A long time ago, I thought it was a cool name—reflecting a passion for infosec and old-school hacking. I'm still a wannabe, and always will be. But the domain name no longer makes sense.

> Am I getting old?

Here we are, using your first and last name as a domain for a personal site and blog is a win-win situation.

It should also be more SEO-friendly! The end goal is to elevate it to the top or at least the second place in searches for Ivan Zakutnii :)

## So Now What?

As for the content, I won't folow tha old "teaching" style anymore. I promise to do my best to avoid being academically nauseating.

The issue is not just the style of storytelling, but also the perspective.

I've literally forgotten when I last wrote **strictly** from my own perspective.

I can't remember when I last shared my personal thoughts and experiences. It was probably a long time ago, in the first iteration, when I was still writing in Russian.

So, I want to switch back to this approach. I believe that even "boring" topics shared through this lens will be more engaging.

I am not going to change the subjects of my posts—System and Software Designs are still here, and I am still studying a lot of stuff.

But this *should* get much easier. <3

Thank you for your attention.
