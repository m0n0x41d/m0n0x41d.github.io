### Intuitions Are Experience
Generally, awareness of the gap with reality between the phenomenon under consideration (event, object, task, situation) occurs intuitively.

This is a very quick process, but it feels more like a sensation than a clearly formulated, collected awareness.

Such tasks are processed by fast System 1 thinking according to Kahneman,

which compares facts/features related to the evaluated phenomenon with facts/features from a certain "database" that is filled with our explicit and implicit subjective experience throughout life and work in various domains.

> System 1 thinking according to Kahneman is an automatic, fast, and intuitive way of thinking. It works without conscious effort, based on associations and heuristics, allowing us to react almost instantly to situations. This thinking requires little energy, is based on habits/experience, and is highly susceptible to cognitive biases.

When fast thinking finds inconsistencies, we feel it vaguely as "something's off," "they're talking/suggesting nonsense," or conversely, if we hear consistencies ‚Äì "I feel in my heart that this is the holy truth, everything is right!"

It's very important to pay attention to both of these feelings, especially the feeling of wrongness. Anatoly Levenchuk in his School of Systems Management courses suggests an interesting term for this feeling - "ontological buzz." I'm introducing it here because I like it and plan to use it further. Recognizing ontological buzz is important because it's a clear indicator of some gaps between perceptions and reality, or between perceptions and other perceptions (your own or others') ‚Äì both types of failures need to be caught and fixed.

Basic intuition develops "on its own along the way," although it can and should be improved.

### Master's Intuition

A master's intuition is another type of intuition that doesn't quite develop on its own, but rather the opposite.

Such intuition is a painstaking process of transitioning from unconscious incompetence to unconscious competence, where the latter is precisely the "master's intuition."

There's a "competence square" that perfectly illustrates the path along which this type of skill develops:

<< ADD ILLUSTRATION >>

At the very beginning of working in a new domain, when we're just learning a new layer of information and "how to do things here," we can't even say what we don't know. This is unconscious incompetence.

Gradually, we develop skills and mastery (this is the applied mastery I wrote about last week), until this mastery is honed to the point where we become able to apply it automatically.

At this stage, we begin to notice inconsistencies in our own or others' words (spoken or written), documentation, and other sources of information when it comes to the domain of our mastery.

> If we have problems with emotions and self-control, then possessing such a degree of applied mastery can lead to "getting angry at the idiots around me," and this is a big problem, a healthy topic for a separate conversation.
> In any case - pay attention if you notice such consequences of ontological buzz in yourself, this is a destructive pattern and generally a sign that you need to work on basic mastery of collectedness. There can be many reasons, both biochemical (simply problems with hormones that you don't know about or know but don't allocate enough strength and attention to fight them), and psychoneurological. The latter seem easier to work through, but this is not certain and not my area :)

### The "Fundamentally First" Skill of Catching Ontological Buzz

Both types of intuition are needed and important; it's useful for us to know about them and consciously develop them.

Timely awareness of ontological buzz is one of the basic skills of applied mastery of collectedness that is very important for us to hone.

The problem here is that we can too often either not be aware of these inconsistencies at all, or let them "go in one ear and out the other."

Such bypassing happens because we don't realize how important an indicator this ontological buzz is, and we don't know how to work with it at all.

This is expressed in feelings like ‚Äì "Uh, he's not quite right, doesn't quite understand how 'it really is here,' damn... how can I even come to an agreement with him... who knows, I'll try saying the same thing in different words several times, maybe he'll understand somehow?"

After 15-20 attempts, we fall into depression because "it's impossible to agree and work with this colleague, he/I am stupid and don't understand anything."

I won't be studying how to talk for a while, that's in a separate School of Systems Management course, so we're learning sequentially :)

Well, now (hopefully) we've realized the importance of catching ontological buzz. But still ‚Äì how do we work with it? Without special details from "personality engineering," we actually already know how:

> Ground the gap between perceptions and reality.

You can start by capturing semantic patterns in communication with colleagues, and in communication with "yourself," these kinds of signals.

Well... in principle ‚Äì an alert.

Such communicative patterns may include:

- A vague, stumbling answer to a question ‚Äì an answer without confidence, with stutters, hesitations. Lack of confidence and specificity in the answer may, and often does, indicate that the words are poorly connected to reality;
- Phrases like "sort of possible," "well, in principle, we'll do it," "theoretically doable" are present ‚Äì the loudest signals of a disconnect from reality, requiring immediate intervention.
- Too long, drawn-out answer to a quite specific question ‚Äì the respondent either didn't understand the question, then we need to clarify it ourselves. If after clarifying the question the answer is still too vague ‚Äì we need to pay closer attention;
- And conversely, too quick an answer to a question which (as we know) requires some analysis and reflection ‚Äì for example, the universally loved task estimation, where the developer instantly replies "I'll do it in two days";
- Vague phrases without any grounded specifics ‚Äì "we're making a digital product," what kind? "we're developing fintech API" - which one? what features? "We're producing packaging" ‚Äì what kind? Cellophane bags? Cardboard boxes? Dry containers made of nodular cast iron for radioactive rods?

These are basic examples to start with. As we develop mastery in attention to ontological buzz, we develop our own signals, you could say we're filling that "database" for intuition that we talked about earlier.

Next time we'll talk in more detail about "grounding" itself, "reality," how to see them, and what might prevent us from seeing them clearly.
